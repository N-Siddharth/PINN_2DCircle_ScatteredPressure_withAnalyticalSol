# PINN_2DCircle_ScatteredPressure_withAnalyticalSol

A novel physics-informed neural network (PINN) focused on predicting scattered pressure field (p_s) with a 2D circular scatterer inside a square domain is developed. The details of different parts of the code are included in the main.py file documentation part.

The PINN is trained on a circular scatterer of radius = 0.05m. The testing (figure below) was carried out on a scattered field generated by a circular scatterer of radius = 0.1m. It is observed that the PINN-2Dcircle can generalize well for circular scatterer of any radius.
